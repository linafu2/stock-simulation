# stock-simulation
A stock analysis program to buy/sell stocks in a portfolio and analyze performance with real API stock market data. 

The simulation can be run with either a text-based interface or a graphical interface.

Both interfaces allow the following features:
  - Creating a portfolio of stocks
  - Buying/selling stocks in a portfolio
  - Viewing a portfolio's value ($) or composition (shares) on a specified date.
  - Saving a portfolio to an xml file/loading a portfolio from an xml file
  
The text-based interface has additional features not in the GUI:
  - Plotting a bar chart to view the average performance of a stock/portfolio over time.
